# applescript_reminder_app

Last Updated 5/27/2017

This is an application that is designed to use applescript to interface with a Numbers spreadsheet that is acting as a database.

The applecript allows you to put in things that you need to do, add dates that they are due, add an estiamted completion time,
and categorize the todo items.

There is also a feature that calculates how much free time you have based on events in your calendar but a bug that has
not been fixed is that if you have a repeated event, it will only count the first instance of the event. This free time
is used to give you insight into how efficient you spent your time that day. The code has hard coded thresholds for 
efficiency.
